Grid Development Folder:

Grid will be the first controller developed for the project. It will consist of 32 buttons arranged in a 4x8 grid pattern. The device will have a small display for feedback and user interface applications. For UI control, the device will have an undetermined amount of encoders and buttons to navigate menu options and toggle display states.

Proposed Features:
- Soft touch grid buttons with LED feedback
- OLED Display
- Scale setting
- Auto Chords
- Sequencer
- Looping
- MIDI over USB Player
- Assignable and customizable hardware inputs

Hardware:
- 4 x 8 (32 buttons) grid array
- Small OLED Display
- Encoders
- Grid button LEDs for display states/ feedback
- Built on Teensy microcontroller (Teensyduino, Arduino IDE Development)
